## Introduction

This repository is a collection of C++ programs that demonstrate the implementation of common Data Structures and Algorithms. The goal is to provide a resource for learning and practicing these concepts.

## Data Structures

- **LinkedList**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stack**: Implementation of a stack using arrays or linked lists.
- **Queue**: Implementation of a queue using arrays or linked lists.
- **BinaryTree**: Basic operations on binary trees, including traversal methods.
- **Heap**: Implementation of a binary heap (min-heap and max-heap).

<!-- Add more data structures as needed -->

## Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search and Linear Search.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- **Dynamic Programming**: Examples of problems solved using dynamic programming.

<!-- Add more algorithms as needed -->

## Usage

Each subdirectory within the repository corresponds to a specific data structure or algorithm. Inside each directory, you'll find the C++ source code along with a README providing additional details, explanations, and usage examples.

To run any of the programs, follow the instructions provided in the respective README files.

```bash
# Example: Compile and run a C++ program
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
