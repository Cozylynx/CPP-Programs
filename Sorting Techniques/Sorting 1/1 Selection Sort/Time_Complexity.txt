for the first time  it runs for n
for the next n-1
for the next n-2

runs for 1 
which is nothing but 
n + n-1 + n-2 ......... + 2 + 1
which is nothing but sum of the first n numbers 
n(n+1)/2
which is n^2 + n/2
and we ignore the terms in sum in the time complexity 
hence the time complexity is n^2 
and this is the best, average and worst time complexity
