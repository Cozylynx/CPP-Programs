it is running for 0 - n-1
then              0 - n-2
then              0 - n-3
                  .   
                  .
                  .
                  .
                  0 - 2  
                  0 - 1

we can say that this is 
n + n-1 + n-2 + n-2 ........ + 2 + 1
which is nothing but sum of first n numbers
so, n(n+1)/2
and time complexity will be n^2.

But this is the Worst or the average complexity

For example 2 3 5 15 20
if everything is in the correct order 
the array is in the ascending order 
and we should not do any swaps.

best case will run for O(n)
if we optimise our code.
